# TextureLoader-Compiler
When creating texturepacks they may not be verfied without my(Crafterbots) permission. 

### How-To-Guide
To create texturepacks download the template from the main repo. Then open each one in a photo editor and change the textures to be however you want them. Now that every atlas is changed to your textures. Open up the texture compiler and press on each imagen in it. Finally type in the name of the texture and a description. If you cannot think of a good description just put ``By YourName``.
